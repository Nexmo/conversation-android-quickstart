# Nexmo Android Conversation SDK Quickstart 3

## Running the example

- In `LoginActivity` set the `USER_JWT` & `SECOND_USER_JWT` variables to those generated in [Quickstart 2](../../docs/2-inviting-members.md) (Quickstart 3 doesn't need to generate new JWTs)

- Run the app in Android Studio on two separate emulators/devices

- After clicking the login button, log in as either "jamie" or "alice"
