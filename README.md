## About In-App Messaging and Voice

Nexmo Stitch enables you to build conversation features where communication can take place across multiple platforms. The context of the conversations is maintained through each communication event taking place within a conversation, no matter the medium.

Currently the Stitch API offers IP voice and IP messaging with the following features:

- Conversation creation and management
- Sending and receiving text
- Member invite management
- Cache support
- Typing indicators
- Message sent, delivered and read receipts
- Image support
- Push notifications
